# Design Patterns: Elements of Resuable Object-Oriented Software

## Catalog of Design Patterns
- Abstract Factory: create without specifying concrete classes
- Adapter: convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
- Bridge: decouple abstraction from its implementation -> the two can vary independently
- Builder: separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different implementations
- Chain of responsibility: avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
- Command: encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queues or log requests, and support undoable operation
- Composite: compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- Decorator: attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Subclassing for extending functionality.
- Facade: provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. High-level interface helps subsystem easier to use.
- Factory Method: define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which classes to instantiate.
- Flyweight: use sharing to support large numbers of fine grained objects efficiently.
- Interpreter:
- Iterator: iterating without accessing to underlying implementation.
- Mediator: define an object encapsulating how a set of objects interact.
- Memento: 
- Observer: 
- Prototype:
- Proxy:
- Singleton: 
- State:
- Strategy:
- Template Method:
- Visitor:
