# Design Patterns: Elements of Resuable Object-Oriented Software

## Catalog of Design Patterns
- Abstract Factory: create without specifying concrete classes
- Adapter: convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
- Bridge: decouple abstraction from its implementation -> the two can vary independently
- Builder: separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different implementations
- Chain of responsibility
